# Restaurant-Selector
Trouble picking food? WE GOT YOU.

Using the Google Places and Geocoding and Places APIs, we created a solution for your indecisive needs.

We first use the Geocoding API to turn the user's entered address into coordinates. With that and a few other user inputs, sufficient information is then provided to the Places API to gather restaurants. From there, the user is presented with a randomly selected and a recommended restaurant. If neither restaurants are to liking, a list of all the restaurants are given based off the same user inputs.
